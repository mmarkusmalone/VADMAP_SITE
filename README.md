# VADMap â€“ Emotional Mapping Journal

VADMap is an interactive web application for recording, analyzing, and visualizing journal entries based on their **Valence**, **Arousal**, and **Dominance** (VAD) emotional dimensions. It combines a rich 3D visualization (via [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)) with backend AI-powered sentiment analysis to help users reflect on their emotional journeys over time.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Add Journal Entries** â€“ Record text entries with date stamps.
- **AI-powered Emotion Analysis** â€“ The backend uses a pre-trained model (loaded via `aloadmodel`) to assign VAD scores to each entry.
- **3D Emotional Map** â€“ Visualize your entries in a 3D space based on their emotional dimensions.
- **Filtering & Search** â€“ Filter by keywords, date range, and specific VAD score ranges.
- **Journal Viewing** â€“ Browse and revisit past entries in a modal interface.
- **Interactive Legend** â€“ See how low/high valence, arousal, and dominance map to your visualization.
- **Responsive UI** â€“ Works on various screen sizes.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Frontend**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js (v16+ recommended)
  - npm or yarn
- **Optional**: GPU support for faster model inference (if using a large model)

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vadmap.git
   cd VADMAP-site
2. **Create a Virtual Environment and download the dependencies is requirements.txt**
3. **Load the custom model:**
   Download mmarkusmalone/VAD_Journal_Finetuned from huggingface and save it into the repository
5. **Run the program**
   For the frontend server:
    ``` bash
   npx vite
   ```
  For the backend server:
   ``` bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. **User adds an entry** â†’  
   A modal form collects a date and text.

2. **Backend processes the entry** â†’  
   - The text is sent to the Node.js server.  
   - The `aloadmodel` script loads a sentiment/emotion model.  
   - The model computes **Valence**, **Arousal**, and **Dominance** scores.

3. **Entry is stored** â†’  
   Saved in the backendâ€™s database or JSON file.

4. **3D Visualization updates** â†’  
   - The frontend (`source.js`) plots the entry as a point in 3D space.  
   - Points are color-coded and positioned based on their VAD values.

5. **Filtering & exploration** â†’  
   Users can search and filter entries to see emotional trends over time.
