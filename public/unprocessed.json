But when I started to dance, I was able to have fun and let go. I love dancing. It makes me feel so free and lovely."

I really think I will fail it and there is nothing I can do. Math is so hard. Math ruins my life. At least Henry had dinner with me and reminded me I was smart. He was a happy party of my day."
